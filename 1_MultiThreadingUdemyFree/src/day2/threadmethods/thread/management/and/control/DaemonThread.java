        ------- Thread Management and Control  OR Prevent Thread execution Methods ---------------

 Once you’ve created threads in Java, you need ways to control how and when they execute.
    Java provides several built-in methods in the Thread class to manage thread behavior effectively.

 Putting a thread to sleep
 Waiting for a thread to finish
 Yielding execution
 Setting priorities
 Creating daemon threads
 Stopping threads (the right way)
